Notes about what has/hasn't been included:
- Only public domain translations have been included thus far in order to keep this project as unencumbered by licenses as possible.
- Not all public domain English translations have been included for various reasons:
    - Some translations only have 1 testament but not both.
    - Translations with only minor differences may have been excluded.
    - Included translations have generally been restricted to "major" translations.
    - Within the given "lineage" of translations, the latest translation is usually included, accounting for the above factors as well.
- For the KJV, multiple variations on it exist in the above-mentioned GitHub repository.  It's somewhat of a toss up as to which
    version is the highest quality.  However, a quick look suggested that the KJV text from sacred-texts.com was slightly
    better overall (though not necessarily in all cases), so that was used instead.  This could change in the future if
    closer study leads to one particular KJV variant seeming better.
- The NHEB was briefly considered over the WEB.  However, the NHEB text seemed to be missing some verses (even if they might be
    more "disputed" as not being in certain manuscripts) and doesn't yet seem to have caught on as much yet.  This may be
    something to reconsider in the future.
